# Implementation Patterns

**Practical guides for applying Canon Rules in real code**

---

## What Are Patterns?

- **Canon Rules** = WHAT + WHY (mandatory architecture)
- **Patterns** = HOW (implementation recipes)

Patterns show you how to combine multiple rules to solve real problems.

## Pattern Structure

Each pattern includes:
1. **Problem** - What you're trying to build
2. **Rules Applied** - Which Canon rules are involved
3. **Complete Code** - Copy-paste ready
4. **Variations** - Common modifications
5. **Pitfalls** - What NOT to do
