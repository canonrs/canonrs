# Canon Rules - Chat Onboarding Guide

## 🎯 For New Claude Sessions

### Step 1: Essential Context (Always Include)
```
Please read: core-services/_rules/CANON_RUNTIME_CONTRACT.md
```

This gives you the operational model in ~350 words.

### Step 2: Problem-Specific Rules (On Demand)

When encountering issues, request capsules:

**Hydration issues:**
```
Apply Rule Capsule #27 (Hydration Determinism)
```

**Effect behavior:**
```
Apply Rule Capsule #26 (Effects Per Runtime)
```

**Context not found:**
```
Apply Rule Capsule #24 (Lexical Context)
```

### Step 3: Deep Dive (Only When Needed)

If capsule insufficient:
```
Show full Rule #27
```

## 📊 Credit Optimization

| Approach | Words | Cost |
|----------|-------|------|
| Full rules upfront | 12,000+ | ❌ High |
| Runtime Contract only | 350 | ✅ Minimal |
| Contract + 2 capsules | 1,000 | ✅ Optimal |
| Full rule on demand | 1,000 | ⚠️ Targeted |

**Best practice:** Start minimal, scale up only when needed.

## 🧠 Mental Model

Think of Canon Rules like:
- **Contract** = Constitution
- **Capsules** = Executive summaries
- **Full rules** = Legal documentation

You consult the constitution daily.
You read full legal docs rarely.
