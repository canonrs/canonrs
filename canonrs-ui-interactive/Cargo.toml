# canonrs-ui-interactive
# CSR-ONLY crate.
# 
# ⚠️  CRITICAL: This crate must NEVER be depended on by SSR/server binaries.
# 
# Purpose: Provides interactive wrappers (*_Interactive components) that add
# callbacks and event handling to SSR-safe components from canonrs-ui.
# 
# Architecture:
# - canonrs-ui-interactive → canonrs-ui (one-way dependency)
# - SSR binaries → canonrs-ui (NEVER canonrs-ui-interactive)
# - WASM/hydrate apps → both crates
#
# This separation ensures zero WASM symbol leakage into SSR builds.

# Note: canonrs-ui/hydrate is included for convenience.
# For maximum isolation, this can be removed and activated
# separately in the final app's Cargo.toml.
